The game's logo used to have Arabic numerals instead of Roman: https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/473069/take-twos-red-dead-redemption-2.jpg

Very early leaked screenshot of Canebreak Manor (rifle holster is the same one from RDR1): https://simhost.org/uploads/posts/2016-06/1464843954_red-dead-redemption.jpg
Different color scheme for Dutch's Schofields (top final game, bottom pre-release): https://imgur.com/a/Dpu4jJR
New Hanover used to be more brown and arid, probably before New Austin was added: https://pp.userapi.com/EPmA4yZW2K_J3AYP500shUoR72GeFRZfhRySGg/fGDxkIriYow.jpg
Different Arthur face, unbuttoned shirt with bandana and different duster coat: https://pp.userapi.com/c830509/v830509434/6c90d/sK3czgV_4xk.jpg
Original John outfit, closer to RDR1. Same one that can be unlocked in Red Dead Online. For some reason, in the final game the vest is buttoned all the way down and the gloves are too big: https://pp.userapi.com/c845019/v845019506/43e20/VtIFPG2JLxs.jpg
Cut bandana: http://proximonivel.pt/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/red-dead-redemption-2-2-pn.jpg

The mission "The First Shall Be Last" used to start where the horse icon is, while in the final game it is where the player icon is: https://pp.userapi.com/c845121/v845121650/1485e5/CJvpSBCXRKE.jpg
The sidequest "The Veteran" seems to have been available earlier in the story. Arthur doesn't cough AT ALL in these missions whearas in EVERY mission and a few side quests from Chapter 6 he does so constantly, and catching the fish introduces you to special lake lures being set up as a tutorial on how to catch legendary fish
Javier's VA mentioned originally "Enter, Pursued By A Memory" had a section with Javier fighting off wolves with a torch in a cave
Gang members have dialogue for wearing a mask in the camp, impossible in the final game: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/a6gcg9/the_game_let_me_wear_a_mask_in_camp_and_it_turns/
Cut quiver for the bow located where the satchel is: https://cdn.segmentnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-Weapons.jpg
Cut animal, the Green Turtle. It cannot be skinned and you can walk through it. You can study it but it won't be added to the compendium: https://i.redd.it/n5v7jjye58421.jpg
Taking a picture at certain places reveals their beta name in the Social Club. For example, the waterfall at the top of the map being called "Rocky Seven" or The Strange Man's cabin being called "Serial Killer"
Cut shark found out of Guarma's bounds: https://i.imgur.com/ladfMp8.jpeg
Arthur wearing both a neckerchief AND a bandana: https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rdr2.jpg
The bank in Rhodes has a set of keys on the desk in the vault room that can't be interacted with yet glow in Eagle eye. Leftover from a beta part of the Heist? 
Different looking 1907 Mary-Beth: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/512336642934046721/525033485702791178/chrome_2018-12-19_14-35-18.png

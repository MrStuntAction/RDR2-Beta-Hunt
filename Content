Another similar beta map with the path left of Ambarino where the intro cutscene takes place in being shown, still no New Austin and Guarma being called Guama: https://i.imgur.com/lNtDr8f.png
Following from that, the final game's map border is the purple line. The original map border is the faint brown line running across about halfway down. Tempest Rim is innacessible in the final game: https://i.imgur.com/AOMVpKN.jpeg

Different Arthur face, unbuttoned shirt with bandana and different duster coat: https://i.imgur.com/eCmZczy.jpeg
Original John outfit, closer to RDR1. Same one that can be unlocked in Red Dead Online. For some reason, in the final game the vest is buttoned all the way down and the gloves are too big: https://pp.userapi.com/c845019/v845019506/43e20/VtIFPG2JLxs.jpg
Cut bandana: http://proximonivel.pt/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/red-dead-redemption-2-2-pn.jpg

Seems like Charles' mohawk used to be his default hairstyle instead of being one he changed to in Chapter 5

Cut quiver for the bow located where the satchel is: https://cdn.segmentnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-Weapons.jpg

Leaked 2016 map, showing different Ambarino, no New Austin (this will become a recurring theme), swampier swamps, different name for Saint Denis, the ability to move the gang's camp at will, replacing an enemy gang hideout called Tallulah Jetty for Van Horn, beta Guarma and much more: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/4/46/2016_Leaked_Map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210521043155

Seems like Charles' mohawk used to be his default hairstyle instead of being one he changed to in Chapter 5

In Arthur's final journal entry, he tells Rains Fall to save his son, because he lost his people. Either the beta version was for the tribe to die and the son to live, or some intern mixed the two up
Fort Wallace was originally supposed to be in the Grizzlies East: https://i.imgur.com/6pyfl1F.jpg, https://i.imgur.com/HPnEgeu.jpg

Leaked 2016 map, showing different Ambarino, no New Austin (this will become a recurring theme), swampier swamps, different name for Saint Denis, the ability to move the gang's camp at will, replacing an enemy gang hideout called Tallulah Jetty for Van Horn, beta Guarma and much more: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/4/46/2016_Leaked_Map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210521043155
Another similar beta map with the path left of Ambarino where the intro cutscene takes place in being shown, still no New Austin and Guarma being called Guama: https://i.imgur.com/lNtDr8f.png
Following from that, the final game's map border is the purple line. The original map border is the faint brown line running across about halfway down. Tempest Rim is innacessible in the final game: https://i.imgur.com/AOMVpKN.jpeg, https://youtu.be/icutoROHTxU
The game's logo used to have Arabic numerals instead of Roman: https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/473069/take-twos-red-dead-redemption-2.jpg

Different Arthur face, unbuttoned shirt with bandana and different duster coat: https://i.imgur.com/eCmZczy.jpeg
Original John outfit, closer to RDR1. Same one that can be unlocked in Red Dead Online. For some reason, in the final game the vest is buttoned all the way down and the gloves are too big: https://pp.userapi.com/c845019/v845019506/43e20/VtIFPG2JLxs.jpg

The sidequest "The Veteran" seems to have been available earlier in the story. Arthur doesn't cough AT ALL in these missions whearas in EVERY mission and a few side quests from Chapter 6 he does so constantly, and catching the fish introduces you to special lake lures being set up as a tutorial on how to catch legendary fish
Seems like Charles' mohawk used to be his default hairstyle instead of being one he changed to in Chapter 5

In Arthur's final journal entry, he tells Rains Fall to save his son, because he lost his people. Either the beta version was for the tribe to die and the son to live, or some intern mixed the two up
Fort Wallace was originally supposed to be in the Grizzlies East: https://i.imgur.com/6pyfl1F.jpg, https://i.imgur.com/HPnEgeu.jpg
Up to version 1.02 "Hunted" will appear on screen like in the Gameplay Trailer when you get into a fight with bounty hunters, and in version 1.00 you lose Honor for killing them
Arthur's VA confirmed in MomoCon 2019 that there was a cut fling between him and Abigail
Cut ability to free roam with companions. NPCs react accordingly, saying "hey boys", "idiots" and the like. O'Driscolls shouting "I got enough bullets for all y'all!" and the Del Lobos saying "We'll kill every last one of you": https://youtu.be/HmVNWGoLQxA?t=247
